# IRImage
Class for grayscale image filtering &amp; manipulation.

This is an image class intended to be used with infrared imaging systems
or any system that generates intensity (grayscale) images.  My goal is
to create an image class that performs most day-to-day tasks without any
dependency on the Image Processing Toolbox.

Planned features:
  * Intuitive convolution methods
  * Padding & mirroring of edge content
  * Filter kernel generation
  * Basic morphological processing
  * Noise addition
  * Snipping out sub-images
  * Line-of-Sight bookkeeping
  
This is still very much so a work in progress.
